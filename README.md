# carUFP

Welcome to this repo on GitHub (my first!), it contains python script files that were thought for the resolution of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program Final Project: System Integration Project.

So, along with this README.md file, you also have the CarND-Capstone-master, that contains the files necessary for compilation of this project.

This final project is done in groups. The group for this project consist of the following members:
